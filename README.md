# üå≤ Tree Species Classification using 3D Point Clouds & Multi-view Approaches

## üß© Project Overview
This project focuses on **implementing and comparing different methods** for **tree species classification** using 3D point cloud data and multi-view image techniques.  
The objective is to evaluate the performance of several classification pipelines to identify which approach performs best.

## üß† Classification Methods

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Indirect (2D Multi-view Approaches)
- Multi-view + Classical Descriptors + Classical ML Model  
- Multi-view + CNN (trained from scratch)  
- Multi-view + Pretrained CNN (Fine-tuning & Transfer Learning)  
- Multi-view + Pretrained CNN + Classical ML Model  
- Multi-view + Descriptors + CNN (Data Fusion)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quasi-direct Methods
- Apply **3D descriptors** directly on point clouds  
- Use **classical ML algorithms** for classification

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Direct Methods
- Deep learning directly on 3D point clouds  
  - **PointNet** ‚Üí [Implementation](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet)  
  - **DGCNN** ‚Üí [Implementation](https://github.com/WangYueFt/dgcnn)
